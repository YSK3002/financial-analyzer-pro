# Financial Document Analyzer Pro üöÄ

## 1. Project Overview

This is an AI-powered Financial Document Analyzer built with CrewAI. The system accepts a financial PDF document (e.g., a quarterly report), processes it through a crew of specialized AI agents, and returns a comprehensive analysis covering the company's financial health, investment potential, and key risks.

This "Pro" version has been upgraded to handle concurrent requests using a **Celery worker and Redis queue**, and it stores all analysis results in a **SQLite database** for persistence and easy retrieval.

## 2. Bugs Found and How They Were Fixed üêõ

The original codebase had two categories of issues: **Deterministic Bugs** and **Inefficient Prompts**.

### Deterministic Bugs (Code Errors)

| File | Bug Description | The Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`requirements.txt`** | Several required libraries (`python-dotenv`, `pypdf`, `langchain-community`) were missing, which would cause the application to crash on startup or during PDF processing. | Added the missing libraries to the `requirements.txt` file to ensure a stable installation. |
| **`tools.py`** | The PDF reading tool (`read_data_tool`) tried to use an undefined class `Pdf`, leading to a `NameError`. | The tool was rewritten to use the industry-standard `PyPDFLoader` from the `langchain-community` library, ensuring reliable PDF text extraction. |
| **`agents.py`** | The code included a syntax error (`llm = llm`) and failed to instantiate a Large Language Model. | The erroneous line was replaced with proper instantiation of the `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` client, connecting the agents to the Gemini model. |
| **`main.py`** | The application did not pass the uploaded file's path to the AI crew. It was hardcoded to always analyze a default `sample.pdf`, ignoring user uploads completely. | The `kickoff()` method call was corrected to include the `file_path` of the uploaded document, ensuring the crew analyzes the correct file. |

### Inefficient Prompts (AI Instruction Errors)

| File | Inefficiency Description | The Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`agents.py`** | The agent `role`, `goal`, and `backstory` prompts were written as jokes, instructing the AI to provide useless, sarcastic, and fabricated financial advice. | **Complete Rewrite:** All agent prompts were rewritten to be professional and specific. They are now instructed to act as expert financial analysts, verifiers, investment advisors, and risk assessors, ensuring high-quality, relevant output. |
| **`task.py`** | The task `description` and `expected_output` were also nonsensical, guiding the AI to generate random text and fake URLs. | **Complete Rewrite:** All task prompts were rewritten to provide clear, actionable instructions. The tasks are now structured logically and align with the professional personas of the agents, defining a clear path to a comprehensive financial report. |
| **`main.py`** | The original crew consisted of only one agent performing one task, which was a highly inefficient use of the specialized agents defined in the code. | The crew was redesigned into a **sequential process** that leverages all four specialized agents. The workflow is now: **Verify -> Analyze -> Advise -> Assess Risk**, which produces a much more thorough and valuable analysis. |
